# PHP EPL Printer
======================

A library containing helper methods to make printing EPL (Eltron Programming Language) easier. This library uses command line printing which is being developed on Windows.

### Setting up the Printer
It is important that the printer is setup correctly for use with the command line print tool. This tool doesn't directly support USB printers. The easiest way to make it work (and the method this library defaults to) is to share the printer. The printer is then accessed via it's shared name with USB support!

### Compatible Printers

In theory this should work with any Windows printer that supports EPL (Eltron Programming Language).

#### Tested With:

* Zebra LP2844 (USB) Direct Thermal Printer

#### Copyright and License

PHP EPL Printer was written by Simon Corless (currently under no licence), it's very much unfinished and no responsibility can be taken for use of this code.
